# Test Task
##TL;DR
I failed.

## About
Due to my lack of knowledge that seems to be required to satisfy all of conditions for your test task and lack of communication on your part I see no sense in even trying to finish the task you have given. However, in order to provide an example of my code I present to you this project. I do not anticipate any form of response from you as you have shown no interest in discussing or further explaining the problem you have given.  

## Usage
This project contains CMakeLists. CMake should be used to create Makefile and compile the program.
Upon starting the program a window should appear with randomly positioned points connected randomly into a graph. One can use left and right mouse buttons to set starting point and destination point respectively. Clicking mouse wheel anywhere will clear the points. The program also tries to calculate a path visiting all nodes starting with the first point but it mostly fails. Click a point to set it as a start point. The program calculates path. Most of the time incorrectly. It also prints out values. Since this is a fail I don't think it's worth it to explain those.

## P.S
Yes, I could use a map to represent the graph. No, I did not want to do so.
